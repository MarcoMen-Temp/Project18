> Iris Dataset retrieved from: " https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data " and saved as a csv file on Microsoft VS Code.

A Iris.py was opened that will read,retrive and manipulate data from csv(through import function and export of csv files)

I will be using pandas for python,numpy,anaconda python with VS Code,matplotlib and seaborn for this project
